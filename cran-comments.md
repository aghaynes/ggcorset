## Minor Changes

This update includes an addition to the type of 'eyelets' offered as per user feedback. Only this feature was added (none were removed). Other small changes were made to the vignette including adding this new feature. The title of the `theme_ggcorset()` function (as it appears in the user manual) was updated to reflect the name of the function (but no changes to this function itself were made).

Description: This modest package was developed to document a new visualization technique,
 coined the 'corset plot'. It is used strictly to visualize discrete repeat measures data 
 at 2 time points (such as pre- and post- data). The distribution of measurements at each
 time point is visualized using a half violin. Additionally, the trajectory of individual
 change is visualized by connecting these two points linearly, which can be filled to
 represent the percent of change or other user-defined observed value. This method of
 visualization is ideal for showing the true heterogeneity of data.
    The package relies on {ggplot2} to produce the visualizations. As such, the corset plot
 allows for easy integration with {ggplot2}, so that users can customize their visualizations
 as required. This package is geared towards users with limited experience in R, creating corset
 plots using data in either wide or long format using the functions `gg_corset` or gg_corset_elongated`,
 respectively.
